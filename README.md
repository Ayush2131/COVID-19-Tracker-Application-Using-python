# COVID-19-Tracker-Application-Using-python
This is just a simple application, I make Covid-19 Tracker Application Using Python, which you can assume to be a medium level project.I am using three Python libraries in this.  I create a GUI application to track the COVID-19 cases. First of all we need to use three different libraries here. 1. tkinter - for GUI 2. matplotlib - to show data graphically 3. covid - to get COVID data Now, I install "matplotlib" using the pip command given below "pip install matplotlib" Then, Python community has made a library to get the COVID-19 information easily. Library is "covid" and its so simple to use. You can download it using the pip command given below. "pip install covid"-----Type this command in your terminal to install and use this library. Now lets see and understand the code. And at last I say, Don't forget to run on your data during the running of this program.
